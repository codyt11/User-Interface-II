                Hello, My name is Cody. I have long been a fan of technology and am passionate About
                all things relating to the field! For the last 10 years of my life (2010-2020) I have 
                been fulfilling my desire to help others through the health care field. I have learened
                to take responsibility for others and to communicate with others whom it may be difficult
                to comminicate with. I have developed into a team leader as a lead pharmacy technician 
                and have increased productivity every year on the job! However, I have decided to persue
                my passion in computers and am learning to become a full stack developer. Through the 
                interactive and disciplined course work at Lambda Schools I have learned so much already.
                I have learned HTML and CSS and will complete my course work with a complete mastery of
                React, Node, JavaScript, SQL, Java, and Python. I am a dedicated, hard working and loyal
                developer who is always eager to learn and creat the best product for myself and my employer.
            </p>
